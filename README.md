# CodeMage

CodeMage is a web-based application designed to generate code snippets based on user input using the GPT-Neo 125M model from EleutherAI. The application offers a user-friendly interface to describe coding problems and receive code solutions generated by a Large Language Model (LLM).

## Features

- Generate code snippets based on user-described problems.
- Feedback loop for users to improve the generated code.
- Manage and test code snippets within the interface.
- Local execution of the LLM, optimized for CPU performance.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or newer
- Pip for package installation

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArmandoJM/CodeMage
cd CodeMage
```

## Usage

To generate a code snippet:

- Navigate to the main page.
- Describe your coding problem in the provided text area.
- Click the "Generate Code" button to receive a code snippet.
- (Optional) Submit feedback for the generated code to help improve future responses.


## Running with Docker

To simplify deployment, you can use Docker to run CodeMage.

### Building the Docker Image

Navigate to the root directory of the project where the `Dockerfile` is located and run the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t codemage .
```

## Running the Docker Container
After the image has been successfully built, you can run your application in a Docker container using:
```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 codemage
```

## Performance Notes

- The application runs on CPU; generation times may vary based on the complexity of the prompt.
- For repeated prompts, consider implementing a caching mechanism to improve response times.
